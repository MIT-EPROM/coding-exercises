h1. Coding-Exercises

Coding-Exercises is not a proper project. Is more like a _box_ in which I'd like to leave the solution to various exercises that I do in my spare time (if any).

Exercises can be of any kind: most notorious "CompSci":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Science problems and less notorious, more "interview-ish":http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=software+engineering+interview&btnG=Search&meta=&aq=f&oq= problems.

If by any chance I happen to be your interviewer, this material could be very helpful. ;-)

h1. Contributions? More then welcome

Of course I'm more then open to contributions and, most probably, corrections and improvements: I'm not a genius and I would actually love to read some code to learn from my mistakes. *So, in case you want to contribute, please fork*.

h1. What problems are in the repo?

The list started small, but in few days I did covered some ground. Most of the problems are simple, but *the aim is always to find the best, most efficient, most elegant solution*. So, don't be surprised if there are, I don't know, 4/5 implementations of a, for example, the _*Fibonacci Sequence Generator*_.
